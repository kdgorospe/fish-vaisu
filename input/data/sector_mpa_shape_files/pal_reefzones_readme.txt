pal_reefzone shapefile was created by CREP largely following the boundaries of the Zone classification (column) in benthic habitat maps generated by the biogeography branch of NCCOS (original data source: O:\GIS\Data\PRIAS\Basemaps\BenthicHabitatLayers\Palmyra_Habitat_Map_Final_wgs84_utm3n.shp). The Zone classes were reclassed into the following:

Zone Classes (biogeography)	New Classes (ros_reefzone.shp)
Back Reef			Backreef
Bank/Shelf			Forereef
Bank/Shelf Escarpment		Forereef
Channel				Lagoon
Dredged				Lagoon
Fore Reef			Forereef
Lagoon				Lagoon
Land				Land
Reef Crest			Forereef
Salt Pond			Land
Unknown				Unknown
